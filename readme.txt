Settings for the guest-advanced shader by Nesguy of the Retroarch forums. 

These settings are intended to be "one size fits all." No need to dig through dozens of console-specific presets, just pick the TVL and signal type you want to emulate and you're good to go. These are designed for a 1080p display. 

The only caveat is that these settings may be somewhat dark on an LCD without adjusting the display backlight. It is recommended that you adjust the display backlight to the maximum setting to get the best results. 

For Sega Systems, it is recommended that you enable "Sega Brightness Fix" in the shader menu settings. 

Installation: place the shader preset files in "RetroArch" -> "shaders"
